# Dexy-AI-ChatBot-
# Introduction
The following project is a AI chatbot for people struggling with stress, depression and anxiety.
Simple ML model was trained in the project on a selfmade dataset from scratch on a simple json file , the model after a lot of parameter tuneing was set to preform 500 epocs with a batch size of 22 and a RNN model was used with 3 layers of 320, 200 and 194 nodes respectively, the model acheived an accuracy of 96% with a loss of only 8 to 10%
Simple custometkinter gui was made just for generaic GUI representation, with dark mode as well.
Python speech recognition algorithms were also used for an intractive user machine intraction.
# Limitations
The dataset for this project is quit limited at the moment and can slove only upto 5% of the given problems, to make this project better in the near future, many approaches are being studied at the moment to enhance and make this project an actual success.
